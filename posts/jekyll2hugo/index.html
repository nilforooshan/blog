<p>I started this blog using Jekyll.
First, I had to learn about Jekyll and how to write and maintain a blog with it.
There was definitely a learning curve, but with tons of resources online, it wasn&rsquo;t a huge deal.
The real issue was installing and getting Jekyll to work.
Jekyll is Ruby-based, with a bunch of dependencies like Ruby itself, RVM, Bundler, and gems.
Mismatches between these dependencies can stop Jekyll from installing (like, the OS might be missing some stuff or can&rsquo;t put together compatible dependencies) or even from working later (like after an OS update).</p>
<p>Anyway, after a lot of searching and troubleshooting, I managed to install Jekyll and get it running, and I wrote my first few blog posts.
Then, my OS updated, and, no surprise, my Jekyll broke.
I tried reinstalling and using the same fixes I had before.
Nothing worked!
I found that <a href="https://jacobtomlinson.dev/posts/2019/switching-to-hugo/">others</a> have had the same problems and have switched away from Jekyll.</p>
<h2 id="hugo">Hugo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#hugo">#</a></h2>

<p>Hugo themes make things way easier.
